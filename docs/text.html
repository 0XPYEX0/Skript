<h1>Using Text in Scripts</h1>

Skript allows you to write pieces of text (programmers usually call them strings)
in the scripts. This is done by putting the text inside double quotes, as follows:
<div class="skript-code-block">
"this is text"
</div>
Simple, isn't it? If an effect, expression, condition, trigger or function
accepts something of type <pre>text</pre>, you can use this format to write it
right there!
<h2>Formatting Text</h2>
But isn't just text a bit boring? Worry not, as Minecraft has support for colors
in chat and item names. Skript allows you to use them, too.
